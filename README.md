# Event Driven simulations on Coupled Oscillators
A discrete phase coupled oscillators model was [introduced](https://journals.aps.org/prl/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevLett.96.145701 "Universality of Synchrony: Critical Behavior in a Discrete Model of Stochastic Phase-Coupled Oscillators")
by Wood et al as an example of a non-equilibrium system which presents
equilibrium-like properties near a phase transition.

Here we present some code to perform a dynamical simulation of this model on
arbitrary connection graphs between oscillators.
